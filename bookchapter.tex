\section{Introduction}
\todo{2 page}
- explain the definition of software evolution (cite: belady and lehman, etc)
- describe why this chapter focus on code changes, rather than other types of artefacts such as requirements, specifications, design documents, etc. 
- argue why software evolution is important (cite: code decay, eick et al.) 

\section{Concepts and Principles}
\todo{4 page} 
- explain a broad category of changes: corrective, adaptive, and perfective changes (cite kemerer and slaugher)  
- include a diagram about the process of software evolution with focus on changes: (A) applying program changes (B) inspecting program changes, and (C) debugging and testing program changes to overview the rest of sections.  
- introduce topics under each of the three perspectives on program changes. 

\section{An Organized Tour of Seminal Papers from Three Perspectives} 

\subsection{Applying Program Changes}
\paragraph{Perfective Changes} 
	refactoring is a special category of automated transformation: refactoring practices (kim et al., emerson murphy hill, ralph johnson) 
\paragraph{Corrective Changes} 
	- discuss literature on bug fixes  
\paragraph{Additive Changes}
discuss literature on adding features, (systematic editing is a specialized technique for automated feature addition) source to source transformation 
\paragraph{Porting programs to different languages} 
\paragraph{Porting programs to different platforms} 

\subsection{Inspecting Program Changes}

\paragraph{Code Reviews Practices}
since code reviews is a common context where change inspection happens ( peter rigby)  code flow, collaborators in industry. generally starting from code review practices
\paragraph{Program Differencing} 
program differencing (going to back history of differencing, diff, AST diff, CFG diff, PDG diff.--- mention its symmetric problem of clone detection)
\paragraph{Techniques for Code Change Comprehension} 
go deeper for a few techniques that help with change comprehension: kim et al. critics, chris bird at MS


\subsection{Debugging and Testing Program Changes} 

\paragraph{Delta Debugging: Finding Code Changes Causing Errors}
\paragraph{Regression Testing} 
\paragraph{Change Impact Analysis} 

\section{Future Directions and Open Problems}
