@inproceedings{Dig'05,
abstract = {Frameworks and libraries change their APIs. Migrating an application to the new API is tedious and disrupts the development process. Although some tools and ideas have been proposed to solve the evolution of APIs, most updates are done manually. To better understand the requirements for migration tools we studied the API changes of three frameworks and one library. We discovered that the changes that break existing applications are not random, but they tend to fall into particular categories. Over 80% of these changes are refactorings. This suggests that refactoring-based migration tools should be used to update applications.},

software quality. During the review, there is an exchange of knowledge
between the code author and reviewer that concerns the code being
reviewed. We performed a study that looked at the code review practices
of software product teams at Microsoft. The study results indicated
that code reviews are a point at which design rationale is explicitly
stated, but that retention and recovery of this information is not
well supported in the current environment. The results also indicated
that code reviews in collocated development environments such as
Microsoft use a mix of face-to-face and electronic communication.},

Title = {{ASM}}}  @inbook{Kiczales1997, Abstract = {We have found many programming problems for which neither procedural nor object-oriented programming techniques are sufficient to clearly capture some of the important design decisions the program must implement. This forces the implementation of those design decisions to be scattered throughout the code, resulting in ``tangled'' code that is excessively difficult to develop and maintain. We present an analysis of why certain design decisions have been so difficult to clearly capture in actual code. We call the properties these decisions address aspects, and show that the reason they have been hard to capture is that they cross-cut the system's basic functionality. We present the basis for a new programming technique, called aspect-oriented programming, that makes it possible to clearly express programs involving such aspects, including appropriate isolation, composition and reuse of the aspect code. The discussion is rooted in systems we have built using aspect-oriented programming.},

TITLE =        {Dynamic C++ Classes A lightweight mechanism to update code in a running program },
JOURNAL =      {USENIX Annual Technical Conference (NO 98)},
YEAR =         {1998},
abstract =     {Techniques for dynamically adding new code to a running program already exist in various operating systems, programming languages and runtime environments. Most of these systems have not found their way into common use, however, since they require programmer retraining and invalidate previous software investments. In addition, many of the systems are too high-level for performance-critical applications. This paper presents an implementation of dynamic classes for the C++ language. Dynamic classes allow run-time updates of an executing C++ program at the class level. Our implementation is a lightweight proxy class that exploits only common C++ features and can be compiled with most modern compilers. The proxy supports version updates of existing classes as well as the introduction of new classes. Our language choice and proxy implementation is targeted towards performance-critical applications such as low-level networking in which the use of C++ is already widespread},

machine code in evolution is to constrain mutation and
crossover to ensure syntactic closure. In the novel
approach presented here we use no constraints on the
operators, they all work blindly on the binaries in
memory, but we instead encapsulate the code and trap
all resulting exceptions. The new approach presented
here for machine code evolution on CISC architectures
is based on the observation that modern CPUs can cope
with incorrect programmes and report errors to the
operating system. This way it is possible to return to
very simple genetic operators with the objective of
increased performance. Furthermore the instruction set
used by evolved programmes is no longer limited by the
genetic programming system but only by the CPU it runs
on. The mapping between evolution platform and
execution plattform becomes almost complete, ensuring
correct low-level behaviour of all CPU functions.",
