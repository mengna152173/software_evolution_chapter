	of software product teams at Microsoft. The study results indicated
	that code reviews are a point at which design rationale is explicitly
	stated, but that retention and recovery of this information is not
	well supported in the current environment. The results also indicated
	that code reviews in collocated development environments such as
	Microsoft use a mix of face-to-face and electronic communication.},
