An Organised Tour (page estimate: 25)
I. Making Changes (Na is in charge) (page estimate: 8 1/3)
	1. automated program transformation: refactoring is a subset of automated program transformation (source transformation languages and tools)
	2. refactoring is a special category of automated transformation: refactoring practices (kim et al., emerson murphy hill, ralph johnson) 
	3. systematic editing is another special category of automated transformation. 
II. Inspecting Changes (Miryung with some help from Tianyi) (page estimate: 8 1/3)
	3. code reviews practices, since code reviews is a common context where change inspection happens (
peter rigby)  code flow, collaborators in industry. generally starting from code review practices, but 	
4. program differencing (going to back history of differencing, diff, AST diff, CFG diff, PDG diff.--- mention its symmetric problem of clone detection)
        5. go deeper for a few techniques that help with change comprehension: kim et al. critics, chris bird at MS

III. Assessing Changes (Miryung => Na) (page estimate: 8 1/3) 
	5. debugging and testing with focus on changes: delta debugging 
	6. regression test selection / change impact analysis 
(I haven't really followed up recent work on this.) 
	(broadly lingming's work, fault tracer, milos' work on regression testing)
Miryung will add: delta debugging Mary Jean Harrold + Alex Orso, Fault Tracer, 
Na will supplement later work on change impact analysis regression testing.  

IV. Future Directions & Open Problems. (page estimate: 4)


Conclusion (page estimate: 1/2)

----I am not personally sure whether IV is needed or how much space we will have. 
IV. A case of software evolution with focus on duplication.  
	1. "Making changes" to code clones. e.g. LASE 
	2. "Inspecting changes" to clones e.g., CRITICS 
	3. "Assessing changes" to code clones e.g., Clone Genealogy, Grafter (Tianyi's work)
